# API QA Challenge :rocket:
Welcome to the coding challenge :wave:

Thank you for applying for the QA Engineer position and for participating in our recruiting process. For this position, software development, testing and coaching skills are necessary for best fit with the development team. To evaluate your development and testing skills, we are asking you to complete this coding challenge and prepare to walk through it during our RecDay.

Besides, the challenge should give you an idea about potential upcoming tasks. 

Please push your solution into the repository at least 24 hours before the recruiting day. 

# Task
Imagine this is one of our APIs. 

- Create a test plan.
- Give us some examples of test implementation.
- Push your code into this repository or create your own.
- You can choose your way of implementation.
- We want to be able to execute your implemented tests.
  - Please provide a documentation file on how to run the project. 

If you have any questions or would like to understand certain areas in more depth, feel free to contact me: katrin.jaehn@celebrate.company 
This is not just a figure of speech but a serious offer :-) 

## Technical requirements :computer:
- MacOS âŒ˜ or Linux :penguin:
- Docker :whale2:
- Terminal :tv:
- Git :octocat:

## Get the API
In your terminal run 
```
git clone https://github.com/kartenmacherei/api-qa-challenge-<your initials>
```

## Start the server 
In your terminal go to the newly created folder 
```
cd api-qa-challenge
``` 
then run
```
make up
```
That will start a docker container with the API running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/
if you see the message "Hello world!" everything is correctly setup.

## Stop the server
Run 
```
make stop
```
