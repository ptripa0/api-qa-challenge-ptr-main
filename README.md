# API QA Challenge :rocket:

- Create a test plan.
- Give us some examples of test implementation.
- Push your code into this repository or create your own.
- You can choose your way of implementation.
- We want to be able to execute your implemented tests.
  - Please provide a documentation file on how to run the project. 


## Technical requirements :computer:
- MacOS âŒ˜ or Linux :penguin:
- Docker :whale2:
- Terminal :tv:
- Git :octocat:

## Get the API
In your terminal run 
```
git clone https://github.com/kartenmacherei/api-qa-challenge-<your initials>
```

## Start the server 
In your terminal go to the newly created folder 
```
cd api-qa-challenge
``` 
then run
```
make up
```
That will start a docker container with the API running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/
